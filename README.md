  ## walrs
  #### Like Pywal, but written in Rust
  walrs is a fast, minimalist CLI tool for generating color schemes from wallpapers.  
  It works the same as pywal but is written in Rust, making it faster and more efficient.  
  No external dependencies are required â€” just an app to set your wallpaper.  

  If you're using pywal, you only need to replace the `wal` command with `walrs`.  
  Designed for users who prefer simplicity and speed.
